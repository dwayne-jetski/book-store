# book-store

# Book Store
Book Store is an e-commerce website utilizing the MERN stack, along with Axios, chart.js, Stripe credit card payments and the ISBNdb

I built this project in less than 3 weeks time as my capstone project for devCodeCamp

I have a list of features that I would like to add to it including:
- a my account page for customers
- an orders page for retailers where they can see open orders and move them to completed orders and even print out a pdf order form
